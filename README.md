# WAR-Project

In this project, I aimed to predict the **Wins Above Replacement** (WAR) for baseball players in 2019 using data from the 2016-2018 seasons. WAR is a comprehensive statistic that quantifies a player's overall value by combining their hitting, fielding, and occasionally pitching statistics. It calculated how many more wins a player contributed compared to a replacement-level player, defined as an average non-major league player. By assigning a numeric value to a player's performance, WAR allowed me to gauge their significance to their team.

To achieve this, I utilized machine learning techniques, specifically a linear regression model from **sklearn**. The model was trained on historical performance data, and I evaluated its accuracy using the **RÂ²** metric (r2_score), which measures how well the model's predictions matched the actual data. This approach enabled me to generate accurate predictions of players' WAR for the 2019 season.
